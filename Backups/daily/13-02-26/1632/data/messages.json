      "text": "**Clawe — Multi-Agent Coordination System**\n\nThis is a sophisticated setup! Here's my take:\n\n**What it is:**\n- A squad of 4 AI agents (🦞 Clawe, ✍️ Inky, 🎨 Pixel, 🔍 Scout) that work together\n- Each has their own identity, workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md), and scheduled heartbeats\n- Kanban-style task management with assignments\n- Web dashboard at localhost:3000 for monitoring squad status and chatting with agents\n- Built on Convex (backend) + OpenClaw + Docker\n\n**The Good:**\n- Clean architecture — agents use a CLI (`clawe task:status`, `clawe notify`, etc.)\n- Heartbeat-based scheduling prevents token waste\n- Shared context through Convex + local workspace files\n- Staggered wake times avoid rate limits\n- CLI commands for task management look solid\n\n**The Risk:**\n- This is essentially a **wrapper around OpenClaw** with a Convex backend\n- Your agents run in Docker with their own Anthropic API keys\n- **Cost multiplication**: 4 agents × Anthropic API calls = $$$ adds up fast",

Fast-track FLOW (your task app)**\n- Kanban board, offline, local AI\n- Reuse MIND's architecture (saves time)\n- One codebase, consistent design\n- **Timeline:** 2-3 days to MVP\n\n**2. Simple kanban in MIND (quick win)**\n- Add \"Board\" view alongside list view\n- Use existing folder structure as columns\n- Drag cards between folders\n- **Timeline:** 1 day\n\n**3. Markdown kanban (immediate, zero build)**\n- Simple markdown file with checkboxes\n- Columns as headers: `## To Do`, `## Doing`, `## Done`\n- Works in MIND today, no dev needed\n\n**My recommendation:**\nGo with **#2** — add a kanban view to MIND. You already have:\n- Drag-and-drop infrastructure\n- Folder system (can act as columns)\n- Note cards (perfect as kanban cards)\n\nOne extra view mode, same app, same data.

FLOW Chat → Telegram?**\n**No.** FLOW chat is **read-only**. It shows messages FROM Telegram, but doesn't send back.\n\n```\nTelegram → FLOW: ✅ (synced)\nFLOW → Telegram: ❌ (not possible)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Why Telegram tag but not in Telegram?**\nThose are messages you sent **to me via Telegram** (I reply, conversation flows). They get synced INTO FLOW for your records.\n\nMessages you type **inside FLOW chat** stay in FLOW only.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Dashboard stats — real or demo?**\nMostl",

Writing to them doesn't trigger a new turn for me.\n\n**Real solutions:**\n\n**Option 1 (Proper):** Modify OpenClaw gateway to have `/api/inject-message` that FLOW can call to start a new turn with the message.\n\n**Option 2 (Workaround):** Use `cron wake` to trigger a heartbeat check when new FlowChat messages arrive — still has ~5-10s delay.\n\n**Option 3 (Accept):** FlowChat is for **async** messages (like email), Telegram for **sync** chat.\n\n**What do you want?**\n\n- Should I try **Option 2** (cro",

GitHub push — what about sessions?**\nPer protocol: **Sessions ARE included** in `kai-memory` repo push\n- Workspace files → kai-memory ✅\n- Session files (.jsonl) → kai-memory ✅\n\n**Corrected quote:**\n\n> **Command:** `cd ~/.openclaw/workspace && bash auto-push.sh full`\n> \n> **FLOW backup:** `Repos/flow/app/Backups/daily/13-02-26/1629/`\n> **Sessions backup:** `Kai_Memory/Sessions/13-02-26/1629/` (included in kai-memory push)\n> **GitHub push:** kai-memory (workspace + sessions) + kai-obsidian (vault)\n\n**Proceed with this?**",
